# COM-304: Communication Project. mmWave Radars
This repository contains the material for the mmWave radar project of the course COM-304 at EPFL.

# Studying Material & Resources
[Getting started with TI Radars](https://github.com/hailanzs/comm-proj-radar/wiki): This guide will step you through installation and set up for the TI radars and this GitHub repo.

# Homeworks
There will be two homeworks that will help and prepare you for the project:

- [Ungraded HW1](exercise_1.ipynb),[Ungraded HW2](exercise_2.ipynb): Introduction to radar image processing: beamforming, matched filter, and synthetic aperture radar in one dimension. You should go through the code and understand what everything is doing. There are also two lines of empty code which you will need to fill in. These are the calculations for the beamforming vector and the matched filter distance. This homework is **ungraded**. 
- [Graded HW](evaluation.ipynb): Extend the two algorithms to 2D. There are also 3 questions to answer at the end of this notebook which require you to identify the object that was imaged. The data that you will use can be found in the link below. This homework is **graded**. 

Data is provided at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rPqQznJ2rB3iS7kcQkPsRqtA1RNj6ZbM?usp=drive_link).

# General Info
- **Platforms Storage:** For the mmWave radars, we give them to you for the duration of the project, so you can take them home. If you wish to store them at EPFL, you can book a locker avaliable for students [here](https://mycamipro.epfl.ch/client/lockerassign).
