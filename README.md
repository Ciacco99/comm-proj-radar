# COM-304: Communication Project. mmWave Radars
This repository contains the material for the mmWave radar project of the course COM-304 at EPFL. We have prepared tutorial and videos on background information listed below. We recommend going through the videos in order.

# Studying Material & Resources
-[Getting started with TI Radars](https://github.com/hailanzs/comm-proj-radar/wiki): This guide will step you through installation and set up for the TI radars and this GitHub repo.

We also have videos on relevant background material in wireless sensing and imaging. Go through these videos to get a basic understanding. The radar signal processing videos will contain extremely important information regarding how you will implement your homeworks. Algorithms 1 & 3 correspond to beamforming and matched filter which are the heart of the homeworks.

# Homeworks
There will be two homeworks that will help and prepare you for the project:

- [HW1: 1D Beamforming & Matched Filter](exercise_1.ipynb): Introduction to radar image processing: beamforming, matched filter, and synthetic aperture radar in one dimension. You should go through the code and understand what everything is doing. There are also two lines of empty code which you will need to fill in. These are the calculations for the beamforming vector and the matched filter distance. This homework is **ungraded**. 
- [HW 2: 2D Algorithms](homework_2.ipynb): Extend the two algorithms to 2D. There are also 3 questions to answer at the end of this notebook which require you to identify the object that was imaged. Different students will be assigned different data for evaluation, where each set of data is imaging different objects. The data that you will use can be found in the link below. This homework is **graded**. 

# General Info
- **Platforms Storage:** For the mmWave radars, we give them to you for the duration of the project, so you can take them home. If you wish to store them at EPFL, you can book a locker avaliable for students [here](https://mycamipro.epfl.ch/client/lockerassign).
